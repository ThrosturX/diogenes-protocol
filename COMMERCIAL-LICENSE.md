# Commercial Licensing (Optional Alternative to AGPL)

## Summary

Diogenes Protocol is open source under **AGPL-3.0-or-later** (see `LICENSE`).

If you **cannot** or **do not want to** comply with the AGPL obligations (for example,
you need to embed the work in a proprietary product, or you want to run a modified
version as a closed service without publishing corresponding source), you may request
a **separate commercial license** from the maintainer.

This document is **not** an additional restriction on AGPL users.
If you comply with AGPL, you do not need a commercial license.

## How to request a commercial license

Contact:
- Email: sparog+diogenes@gmail.com
- Include: your use case, distribution model, whether you will modify the project,
  and whether you need trademark/branding permissions.

## Typical terms (to be negotiated)

Commercial licenses commonly cover:
- Scope: internal use / redistribution / SaaS operation
- Whether modifications must be contributed back (optional)
- Support / SLA (optional)
- Fees: one-time or subscription
- Trademark permissions (separate; see `TRADEMARK.md`)
- Warranty and liability disclaimers

## No “non-commercial” restriction

Note: The open-source license does not (and cannot, if it is to remain open source)
forbid commercial use or resale. The AGPL ensures that modified network-deployed
versions remain source-available to users interacting with them.
