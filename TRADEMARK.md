# Trademark Policy

This policy covers use of the project name and visual identity.

## Marks

The following are treated as trademarks/marks of the project/maintainer:

- “Diogenes Protocol”
- Project logos and distinctive visual assets in `docs/assets/img/` (as applicable)

## What you may do (no permission needed)

- Refer to the project by name in a factual manner (“This uses Diogenes Protocol…”)
- Fork the repository under AGPL and modify it
- Distribute unmodified copies, provided you:
  - keep the license and notices intact, and
  - do not imply endorsement by the maintainer

## What you may not do without permission

- Market a modified version using the “Diogenes Protocol” name as if it were the
  official project
- Use the logos/branding to imply endorsement, certification, or affiliation
- Offer paid hosting/support branded as “Diogenes Protocol” without clear distinction

## How to get permission

Contact: sparog+diogenes@gmail.com

## Rationale

The code is free software (AGPL). The name/brand is protected to reduce user confusion,
prevent misrepresentation, and prevent “branding resale” of forks as the official project.
