# Doctrine

> Diogenes might say: do not ask whether power is honest. Ask whether power can prove it.

## Axioms (MVP)

1. Prefer verifiable state over verbal assurance.
2. Preserve evidence before escalation.
3. Deadlines convert disputes into facts.
4. Privacy is operational independence, not secrecy.
5. Institutions optimize for convenience unless constrained.

## Method (MVP)

1. Establish observable state (what is true right now, and how do you know).
2. Preserve artifacts (tickets, headers, screenshots, recordings, logs).
3. Invoke the proper mechanism (policy, contract, statute, regulator).
4. Let timelines mature into provable noncompliance if needed.
5. Escalate only with an evidentiary packet.

## Failure modes (MVP)

- “Rebooked” without ticket reissue / valid confirmation
- “We can’t” when they mean “we won’t”
- Evidence disappearance (retention, logs, call recordings)
- Deadline dilution (endless “please wait” loops)
