# Tools

MVP tooling will focus on:

- generating a new case-study skeleton
- generating an evidence inventory file
- producing a shareable “packet” directory layout

Swiss-army tooling comes later.

## Scripts (MVP)

- tools/scripts/new-packet.sh — create an evidence packet layout
- tools/scripts/hash-inventory.sh — compute SHA256 hashes into EVIDENCE-INVENTORY.md
