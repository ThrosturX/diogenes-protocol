# The Diogenes Protocol

> Diogenes might say: Do not ask whether power is honest. Ask whether power can prove it.

## Core Principles

### 1. Procedural Truth Over Verbal Assurance
Claims are meaningless without verifiable procedural state.

### 2. Audit Trails Are Leverage
Power behaves differently when observed and recorded.

### 3. Privacy Is Independence
Privacy is not secrecy. Privacy is the ability to act without external interference.

### 4. Systems Fail Predictably
Institutional failures follow patterns. These patterns can be anticipated and exploited defensively.

### 5. Evidence Before Escalation
Never escalate without securing evidence. Never assume evidence will persist without intervention.

## Operational Doctrine

When interacting with any institution:

1. Establish observable state
2. Preserve all communications
3. Invoke formal procedural mechanisms
4. Allow procedural deadlines to mature
5. Escalate only when procedural violations become provable

## Strategic Objective

The objective is not conflict.

The objective is procedural alignment between institutional claims and institutional reality.

Truth emerges when systems are forced to reconcile their internal state with external scrutiny.

Diogenes carried a lantern in daylight.

The lantern was not for illumination.

It was for verification.
