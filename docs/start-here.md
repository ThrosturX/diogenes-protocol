# Start Here (5 minutes)

Diogenes might say: if it isn’t verifiable, it isn’t real.

## 1) Preserve evidence first
Before you argue, capture:
- screenshots (with timestamps visible where possible)
- emails (headers if you can)
- booking/ticket numbers, account IDs, reference codes
- receipts (itemized)
- call logs / recordings (where lawful)
- chat transcripts

Create a local folder and copy everything into it immediately.

## 2) Write a timeline (UTC)
Create a short timeline of events in UTC:
- YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ — what happened, and what artifact proves it

## 3) Pick the right mechanism
Use the minimal mechanism that forces verifiable state:
- privacy: DSAR / deletion / retention hold
- airline: EU261 rerouting/reimbursement + expenses
- general: written complaint with an evidence packet

## 4) Send one clean message
Short, structured, and attached evidence list.
Do not negotiate; do not speculate; do not insult.

## 5) Let deadlines mature into facts
If they miss a statutory/contractual deadline, you gain leverage.
Escalate with the packet when noncompliance is provable.
