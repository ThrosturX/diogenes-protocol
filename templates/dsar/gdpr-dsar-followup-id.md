# GDPR DSAR Follow-up — Minimal Identity Verification

Subject: Re: Data Subject Access Request (GDPR) — [Your Name]

To: [Company / Data Controller]

Thank you. I will provide only the minimum information necessary to verify identity.

Please specify:
1) the exact verification you require,
2) why it is necessary and proportionate for this request,
3) how long you will retain any verification data you collect for this purpose.

I can confirm the following identifiers already associated with my account/relationship:
- Name: [Name]
- Email: [Email]
- Account/Reference: [ID]
- Recent activity/date: [Optional]

If you require further verification, please offer an alternative that does not require submitting government ID unless strictly necessary.

Regards,
[Name]
