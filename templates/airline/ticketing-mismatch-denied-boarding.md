# Airline: Ticketing mismatch / “reprotected but not ticketed” (Starter)

Subject: Urgent — Denied Boarding Due to Ticketing/Confirmation Mismatch — [PNR] — [Date]

To: [Airline Airport Support / Customer Relations]

Booking reference (PNR): [PNR]
Ticket number(s): [ETKT]
Passenger: [Name]
Airport: [Code]
Flight: [Number]
Date/time: [UTC timestamp]

At the airport I was denied boarding because the reservation/status shown to staff did not match the ticket/confirmation state.

Please provide in writing:
1) the segment status and ticket coupon status at the time of denial,
2) what corrective action was taken (reissue/revalidation/endorsement),
3) a copy of the re-accommodation history (PNR history) for this disruption.

Attached: [screenshots / boarding pass / staff notes if any]
