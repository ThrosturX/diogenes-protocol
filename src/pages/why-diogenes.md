# Why Diogenes

## Scope

Diogenes Protocol is for real incidents where you need a clean record: what happened, what you have, what you asked for, and what you’ll do next.

## Posture

Diogenes with a lawyer’s restraint:
- blunt about facts and deadlines
- restrained about claims and insults
- precise about records, receipts, and process

## Non-goals

- Not a hot-take machine.
- Not a legal substitute.
- Not a persuasion contest: the packet does the work.

## What is a packet?

A packet is a self-contained folder: timeline + artifacts + exports + letters. It should stand on its own weeks later.

Diogenes of Sinope (Cynic philosophy) is useful here for one modern reason: **he preferred reality, procedure, and self-sufficiency over appearances and promises**.

This project borrows that posture in a practical way:

- **Minimize dependencies.** If it can be garbage, assume it will be.
- **Prefer verifiable procedure.** A packet beats a phone call. A timeline beats a story.
- **Be hard to mislead.** Plain-text records, reproducible steps, and simple tooling.
- **Aim for dignity, not theatrics.** No guru posture. Diogenes is the messenger; the work is the message.

If you want one habit to adopt: build a *packet* early, keep it updated, and treat it as the source of truth.
