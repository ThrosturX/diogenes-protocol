# Case studies

## What counts as a case study?

A case study should be reproducible:
- Situation + constraints
- Timeline
- Packet contents
- Letters used
- Outcome + lessons

Structure (MVP):

- Context
- Timeline (UTC timestamps)
- Claims made vs. verifiable state
- Evidence inventory
- Mechanism invoked
- Outcome
- Lessons learned

(Placeholders will be replaced with redacted real cases.)

## Publishing rules

See: `case-studies/_PUBLISHING.md` and [Redaction policy](redaction.html).
